Information about the course provided by DataCamp:

"Modeling credit risk for both personal and company loans is of major importance for banks. The probability that a debtor will default is a key component in getting to a
measure for credit risk. While introducing other models in this course as well, we focus on two model types that are often used in the credit scoring context; logistic regression
and decision trees. We will teach you how to use them in this particular context, and how these models are evaluated by banks. This is a very hands-on course, as you will be 
learning all of this using a real-life credit data set in."
